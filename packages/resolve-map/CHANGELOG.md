# [5.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.2.27...@thi.ng/resolve-map@5.0.0) (2021-10-12)


### Build System

* major update of ALL pkgs (export maps, ESM only) ([0d1d6ea](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/0d1d6ea9fab2a645d6c5f2bf2591459b939c09b6))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions

- only ESM modules will be published from now on
- CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
  - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
  - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
  - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
- UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM

Also:
- normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
- cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
- switch from mocha to @thi.ng/testament for all tests






#  [4.2.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.31...@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.2.0) (2020-07-18) 

###  Features 

- **resolve-map:** add support for custom lookup prefix ([bf89503](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/bf89503424887018d120d3960d9d86a992c31c91)) 

##  [4.1.2](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.1...@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.2) (2019-07-08) 

###  Bug Fixes 

- **resolve-map:** fix [#97](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/issues/97), update to consider trailing comma & whitespace ([de9532b](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/de9532b)) 

##  [4.1.1](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.0...@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.1) (2019-07-08) 

###  Bug Fixes 

- **resolve-map:** fix [#97](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/issues/97), update fn arg destructuring ([e68dc19](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/e68dc19)) 

#  [4.1.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.0.12...@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.1.0) (2019-07-07) 

###  Features 

- **resolve-map:** enable TS strict compiler flags (refactor) ([7e7ff2a](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/7e7ff2a)) 

#  [4.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@3.0.16...@thi.ng/resolve-map@4.0.0) (2019-01-21) 

###  Build System 

- update package build scripts & outputs, imports in ~50 packages ([b54b703](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/b54b703)) 

###  BREAKING CHANGES 

- enabled multi-outputs (ES6 modules, CJS, UMD) 
- build scripts now first build ES6 modules in package root, then call   `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib` 
- all imports MUST be updated to only refer to package level   (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of   all unused imported symbols.
