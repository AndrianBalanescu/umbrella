### BREAKING CHANGES

* discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions

- only ESM modules will be published from now on
- CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
  - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
  - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
  - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
- UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM

Also:
- normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
- cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
- switch from mocha to @thi.ng/testament for all tests
