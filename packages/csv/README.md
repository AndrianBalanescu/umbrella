## About

Customizable, transducer-based CSV parser/object mapper and transformer.

Partially ported and extended from the Clojure versions of the
[ws-ldn-1](https://github.com/thi-ng/ws-ldn-1/blob/master/src/ws_ldn_1/day1/csv.clj)
and
[resonate-2014](https://github.com/learn-postspectacular/resonate-workshop-2014)
workshop repos.

### Features

The parser supports customizable delimiters, quoted and unquoted cells, line
breaks within quoted cells. Being transducer based, memory usage is kept at a
minimum by only processing single lines of (pre-split) text. For CSV records
spanning multiple lines (due to line breaks), new results are only
emitted/processed downstream once a _logical_ CSV row is complete.

Also, being transducer based means the parser can be easily integrated into more
complex data preparation, cleaning or conversion workflows. See
[@thi.ng/transducers](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/transducers)
for more details/ideas.

### Status

**STABLE** - used in production

    cols: {
      "country": { tx: upper },
      "latitude": { alias: "lat", tx: float(0) },
      "longitude": { alias: "lon", tx: float(0) },
    }
  },
