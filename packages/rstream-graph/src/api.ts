 * The `fn` function is responsible to produce such a stream transformer
 * construct. The keys used to specify inputs in the `ins` object are

 * {@link @thi.ng/rstream#StreamSync} instances and the
 * input IDs are used to locally rename input streams within the

 * details how these specs are compiled into stream constructs.

/**
 * Specification for a single input, which can be given in different
 * ways:
 *
 * 1) Create a stream for given path in state atom (passed to
 *    {@link initGraph}):
 *
 * ```
 * { path: "nested.src.path" }
 * { path: ["nested", "src", "path"] }
 * ```
 *
 * 2) Reference path to another node's output in the GraphSpec object.
 *    See {@link @thi.ng/resolve-map# | @thi.ng/resolve-map} for details.
 *
 * ```
 * { stream: "/node-id/node" } // main node output
 * { stream: "/node-id/outs/foo" } // specific output
 * ```
 *
 * 3) Reference another node indirectly. The passed in `resolve`
 *    function can be used to lookup other nodes, with the same logic as
 *    above. E.g. the following spec looks up the main output of node
 *    "abc" and adds a transformed subscription, which is then used as
 *    input for current node.
 *
 * ```
 * { stream: (resolve) =>
 *     resolve("/abc/node").subscribe(map(x => x * 10)) }
 * ```
 *
 * 4) Provide an external input stream:
 *
 * ```
 * { stream: () => fromIterable([1,2,3], 500) }
 * ```
 *
 * 5) Single value input stream:
 *
 * ```
 * { const: 1 }
 * { const: () => 1 }
 * ```
 *
 * If the optional `xform` is given, a subscription with the given
 * transducer is added to the input and then used as input instead.
