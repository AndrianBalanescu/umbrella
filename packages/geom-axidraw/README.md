## About

Conversion and preparation of thi.ng/geom shapes & shape groups to AxiDraw pen plotter draw commands. This is a support package for [@thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/geom).

This package only deals with the conversion aspects. The
[@thi.ng/axidraw](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/packages/axidraw)
is responsible for the actual plotter output...

- <sup>(1)</sup> always interpolated/sampled
- <sup>(2)</sup> only interpolated if forced via attrib

### AxiDraw specific shape attributes

All
[thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/packages/geom/)
shape types have support for arbitrary attributes. Different support packages
can then utilize these attribs to customize usage or behaviors. In this case,
any package-specific attribs must be stored under the `__axi` key:

- `clip`: Optional clip polygon vertices (if given only the parts of strokes
  inside that polygon will be plotted)
- `delayDown`: Shape specific delay (in ms), i.e. initial hold time for the
  stroke or when stippling...
- `delayUp`: Delay for pen up command at the end this particular
  shape/polyline/point.
- `down`: Pen down position (in \%) for this particular shape/polyline. Will be
  reset to globally configured default at the end of the shape.
- `speed`: Speed factor (multiple of globally configured draw speed). Depending
  on pen used, slower speeds might result in thicker strokes.
- `sort`: Ordering function (in lieu of full path planning/optimization, which
  is planned for a later stage). For shapes other than `points()`, order of
  appearance is used by default.

```ts
// a circle which will be plotted at only 10% of the normal speed
circle(100, { __axi: { speed: 0.1 } })
```

#### Shape interpolation/resampling

Since many of the supported shapes are not inherently vertex-based, their
boundaries/outlines need to be sampled when they are being converted to
polylines. Therefore, in addition to the above attributes, the thi.ng/geom
package itself also makes use of the `__samples` attribute to control the
re-sampling of individual shapes. Please see the following links for more
details and supported options:

- [`SamplingOpts`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-api/interfaces/SamplingOpts.html)
- [`vertices()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom/functions/vertices.html)

### Draw order

As mentioned above, the default draw order for shapes within a group is order of
appearance. For point clouds, the {@link pointsByNearestNeighbor} ordering
function is used by default, which attempts to minimize travel distance between
points.

Currently, the following ordering functions are available, but custom
implementations can be provided too...

- [`pointsByNearestNeighbor()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-axidraw/functions/pointsByNearestNeighbor.html)
- [`pointsByProximity()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-axidraw/functions/pointsByProximity.html)
- [`shapesByProximity()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-axidraw/functions/shapesByProximity.html)

### Basic usage & examples

The main function of this package is the polymorphic function
[`asAxiDraw()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/geom-axidraw/functions/asAxiDraw.html),
which converts any of the supported shape types into an iterable of
[thi.ng/axidraw](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/develop/packages/axidraw)
drawing commands. This conversion happens **semi-lazily** (via generator
functions) to minimize memory usage and spread out the computational load of the
conversions.

The below example can be directly launched via `node cubics.js` (obviously
provided you have an AxiDraw connected and all listed packages installed):

#### Interpolated polygons

(Result: https://mastodon.thi.ng/@toxi/109473655772673067)

```ts tangle:export/readme-cubics.ts
import { AxiDraw } from "@thi.ng/axidraw";
import { asCubic, group, pathFromCubics, star } from "@thi.ng/geom";
import { asAxiDraw } from "@thi.ng/geom-axidraw";
import { map, range } from "@thi.ng/transducers";

(async () => {
    // create group of bezier-interpolated star polygons,
    // with each path using a slightly different configuration
    const geo = group({ translate: [100, 100] }, [
        ...map(
            (t) =>
                pathFromCubics(
                    asCubic(star(90, 6, [t, 1]), {
                        breakPoints: true,
                        scale: 0.66,
                    })
                ),
            range(0.3, 1.01, 0.05)
        ),
    ]);

    // connect to plotter
    const axi = new AxiDraw();
    await axi.connect();
    // convert geometry to drawing commands & send to plotter
    await axi.draw(asAxiDraw(geo, { samples: 40 }));
})();
```

#### Clipping

(Result: https://mastodon.thi.ng/@toxi/109483553358349473)

```ts tangle:export/readme-clipping.ts
import { AxiDraw, complete } from "@thi.ng/axidraw";
import { circle, group, starWithCentroid, vertices } from "@thi.ng/geom";
import { asAxiDraw } from "@thi.ng/geom-axidraw";
import { map, range } from "@thi.ng/transducers";

(async () => {
    const origin = [100, 100];
    const radius = 50;
    const boundary = starWithCentroid(origin, radius, 5, [1, 0.45], { __axi: { speed: 0.25 } });
    // group of concentric circles using boundary as clip polygon
    const geo = group({}, [
        boundary,
        group({ __samples: 40, __axi: { clip: vertices(boundary) } }, [
            ...map((r) => circle(origin, r), range(2, radius, 2)),
        ]),
    ]);
    const axi = new AxiDraw();
    await axi.connect();
    await axi.draw(asAxiDraw(geo));
})();
```
