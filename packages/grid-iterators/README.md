## About

2D grid and shape iterators w/ multiple orderings.

Provides the altogether 25 following orderings to generate grid coordinates,
including iterators for shape rasterization, drawing, clipping, filling,
processing in general:

### Columns

Also see the filtered version
[`columnEnds2d()`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/column-ends.ts),
which only includes the end points of each column.

### Diagonal

Also see the filtered version
[`diagonalEnds2d()`](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/grid-iterators/src/diagonal-ends.ts),
which only includes the end points of the diagonals.

Some functions have been ported from [Christopher
Kulla](https://fpsunflower.github.io/ckulla/)'s Java-based [Sunflow
renderer](https://sunflow.sf.net).

For more basic 2D/3D grid iteration, also see `range2d()` & `range3d()`
in
[@thi.ng/transducers](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/transducers).

### Flood filling

The `floodFill()` iterator can be used to iterate arbitrary 2D grids using an
user-provided predicate function. The function recursively explores (in a
row-major manner) the space in the `[0,0]..(width,height)` interval, starting at
given `x,y` and continues as long given predicate function returns a truthy
value. Any eligible 90-degree connected regions will be found and iterated
recursively. The predicate function is used to select eligible grid cells
(e.g. "pixels" of sorts).

```ts
// source "image"
const img = [
    "█", " ", " ", " ", "█",
    "█", " ", "█", " ", " ",
    " ", " ", "█", " ", "█",
    " ", "█", "█", " ", " ",
    " ", " ", " ", "█", "█",
];

// flood fill iterator from point (1,0)
// only accept " " as source pixel value
// image size is 5x5
const region = floodFill((x, y) => img[x + y * 5] === " ", 1, 0, 5, 5);

// label filled pixels using increasing ASCII values
let ascii = 65; // "A"
for(let [x,y] of region) img[x + y * 5] = String.fromCharCode(ascii++);

// result image showing fill order
img
// [
//   "█", "A", "B", "C", "█",
//   "█", "I", "█", "D", "E",
//   "K", "J", "█", "F", "█",
//   "L", "█", "█", "G", "H",
//   "M", "N", "O", "█", "█"
// ]
```

### Miscellaneous

optional clipping:
